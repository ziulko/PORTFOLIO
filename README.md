# Portfolio
A repository for my side projects that I work on in my free time while looking for an internship ;p

Repository Description:

This repository is structured into multiple folders, each dedicated to a specific programming language. Within these folders, I’ve built a variety of projects covering different areas such as machine learning (ML), artificial intelligence (AI), web development, cybersecurity, and general software engineering.

Throughout these projects, I actively apply various technologies and tools including SQL, Hibernate, data standardization and cleansing, graph construction and analysis, REST APIs, as well as basic cloud concepts. The repository reflects my continuous learning process and my interest in exploring different aspects of computer science, full-stack development, data processing, and backend engineering.

The projects demonstrate not only my coding skills but also my ability to work with diverse tech stacks, apply best practices, and design solutions with scalability, maintainability, and data integrity in mind.

⚠ Note: This repository is still a work in progress. Some projects are still being finalized or are ready to be added. I am continuously expanding the repository as I complete, polish, and document additional projects.

Feedback welcome:
If you have any suggestions, feedback, or ideas regarding these projects, feel free to reach out — I’d be happy to discuss and learn from your insights!
