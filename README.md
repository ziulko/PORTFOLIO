# Portfolio

This repository contains side projects I work on during my free time while actively looking for an internship.

## Repository Description

The repository is structured into multiple folders, each focusing on a specific programming language or domain. It includes a variety of projects related to:

- Machine Learning (ML)
- Artificial Intelligence (AI)
- Web Development
- Cybersecurity
- General Software Engineering

## Technologies and Concepts Used

The projects demonstrate use of:

- SQL and relational databases
- Hibernate and other ORM tools
- Data standardization and cleaning
- Graph construction and traversal
- RESTful API design
- Cloud concepts (basic)
- Efficient use of system resources (memory, CPU, threads)
- Modular and scalable architecture design

These projects reflect my interest in full-stack and backend development, data engineering, and systems programming. I aim to create solutions that are maintainable, efficient, and aligned with best practices.

## Status

This portfolio is a work in progress. Some projects are still being finalized or will be added later. Others may lack full documentation or testing but are under active development.

## Feedback

Suggestions, ideas, or constructive feedback are always welcome. Feel free to reach out or open an issue.
