# Auto Workshop "WEB"
# Project Description

Auto Workshop "WEB" is a lightweight web application tailored for small auto repair shops. Its primary goal is to assist mechanics and shop staff in managing daily operations, such as tracking inventory, maintaining client vehicle records, logging service history, planning future visits, and ordering necessary parts.

The current version focuses on the mechanic's interface, providing essential tools for internal shop management. Support for client interaction and more user roles is planned for future development.

âš  Note: This project is a work in progress. Some features are still being finalized or in early stages of implementation. Expect changes as the application evolves.
